Thanks @Tiann for the Kernel Driver and the Manager Binary.
The Manager is provided here under the permissiveness of GPL-3 [https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU/blob/main/LICENSE]

Given the nature of the KernelSU driver module it is ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE that there is a manager bundled in that can protect the user from themselves. This is only here as additional security and more importantly as insurance.
The user can choose to get rid of it, or they can leave it as is.
